I will be using Foursquare API's data to do my analysis.
Firstly, I would be collecting data for the neighborhood of Toronto through web scraping. 
Secondly, I will collect the data to know what all venues or venue categories are present in each of the neighborhood.
Third, I will list out most common visited venues in the given neighborhood using Foursquare API.
Fourth, I will try to visualize through graph that which area is suitable for which type of bussiness. 
Lastly I will cluster the data most suitable for different types of bussiness people may opt for the particular place.
