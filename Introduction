Introduction
In this project I will try to recommnd the best place in Toronto or near Toronto for various scenarios. For example: If someone is looking up for new business such as opening Restaurant/Bar/Gym/Bookstore/Cafe etc then what is the opt location to be chosen so that their business should bloom.
Now let's see why this is important to pick up a best place to open up your business startup. It is important to know that in the place where you are opening a restaurant or Cafe, whether people often visit that place for that particular reason only or there is some other reason why people go to that area. For example if we open a retaurant which is more popular among the people because of local GYM or any fitness centre then your Restaurant may not be that much of success then the place where we already have different restaurants in the area. Bcause people would try to look for new and better option if we are going to open an restaurant in an area where one restaurant tis already present. Or you can say people may want to try out new GYM eqipments provided by new gym centre and their services rather than if place a GYM in an area which is popular among foody kind of people looking for new food items.
