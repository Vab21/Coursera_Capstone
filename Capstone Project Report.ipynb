For example: If someone is looking up for new business such as opening Restaurant/Bar/Gym/Bookstore/Cafe etc then what is the opt location to be chosen so that their business should bloom.\nNow let's see why this is important to pick up a best place to open up your business startup. It is important to know that in the place where you are opening a restaurant or Cafe, whether people often visit that place for that particular reason only or there is some other reason why people go to that area.

Or you can say people may want to try out new GYM eqipments provided by new gym centre and their services rather than if place a GYM in an area which is popular among foody kind of people looking for new food items.\n\nSo the target audience over here will be the business owners looking to open their start up plan. \n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "# Data", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "I will be using Foursquare API's data to do my analysis. <br>\nFirstly, I would be collecting data for the neighborhood of Toronto through web scraping. <br>\nSecondly, I will collect the data to know what all venues or venue categories are present in each of the neighborhood.<br>\nThird, I will list out most common visited venues in the given neighborhood using Foursquare API.<br>\nFourth, I will try to visualize through graph that which area is suitable for which type of bussiness. <br>\nLastly I will cluster the data most suitable for different types of bussiness people may opt for the particular place.<br>", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.5", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.5", "name": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}, "nbformat": 4}
